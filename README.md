##### Your computer does greek grammar for you! (sorta)

This is a python library, which declines, conjugates and messes with
Ancient Greek words according to the (OCR) GCSE specifications.

We have tried to make it as accurate as possible, and catch all the edge cases, but as you (might) know,
this is no easy task. Please feel free to submit an issue, or even a pull request if you're feeling brave.

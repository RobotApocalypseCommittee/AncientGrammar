When you can't be bothered to do greek yourself so you spend hours trying to get your computer to do it for you only to realise your greek GCSE exam has happened already and you missed the exam so you failed so you didn't get your A* you were hoping for so you get depressed and have a panic attack on the day of your exams so you fail them all and then can't get into university and your life is ruined and it's all a bit sad.



But hey, at least your computer does greek grammar for you! (sorta)
